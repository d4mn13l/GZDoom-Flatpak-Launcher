# GZDoom Flatpak Launcher

Launcher for flatpak GZDoom i made bc i was annoyed by the way starting GZDoom works
allows you to select iwad and pwad to launch flatpak gzdoom instead of having to use the command line

iwads must be located at ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom
pwads must be located at ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/wads

place the .desktop file at ~/.local/share/applications and the python script at ~/code/GZDoom-Flatpak-Launcher to create a menu entry

dependencies: tkinter
